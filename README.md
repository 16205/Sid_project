## Introduction

The goal of this project was to design a 3D scanner, develop an interface and scripts to output the scanned object into a 3D STL file, ready to import into a 3D CAD design software.  

This project is still in a phase of a prototype and therefore not a finnished product.  
All the files for the interface, the script, the PCB and the 3D CAD designs were developped in an "Open-Box" extensibility model. The ```main``` branch contains the code, the ```pcb``` branch contains the PCB design files and the ```3D-printed-hardware-CAD``` branch contains the models to print.  

## 1. Material used

- 2 Raspberry pi 4
- 2 Raspberry pi camera (module V2.1)
- 1 Stepper motor (Nema 17 10:1)
- 1 driver (A4988)
- 1 Power supply AC/DC 5V and 12V
- 1 display 11"
- 1 red line laser (HLM1230)


## 2. Interface (Kivy)

The interface files are stored inside the folder [/code/screen/](https://github.com/16205/Sid_project/tree/main/code/screens). 
Inside, there are 4 files, each for a specific screen interface.  

### 2.1. HomePageScreen
This corresponds to the home page of the interface. The user is presented with 4 buttons : 
- **Run**, to access the ```RunScreen```;
- **Settings**, to access the ```SettingsScreen```;
- **Storage**, to access the ```StorageScreen```;
- **Exit**, to exit the application.

### 2.2. RunScreen
This interface contains all the quick parameters to set before a scan and the button to start a scan :
- **Resolution** is used to set the number of pictures taken;
- **Scale** is used to set the size of the object to scan;
- **Laser power** is used to adjust the intensity of the laser;
- **The set of 3 radio buttons** helps visualize the pictures taken in different color spaces.

### 2.3. Settings
This interface is used to setup the calibration needed to scan (only the first time the application is launched) :
- **Connect** helps setting up the video stream of the slave raspberry pi camera;
- **Slave(L)** and **Master(R)** are used to have a video feedback of the 2 cameras;
- **Capture/Calibrate** launches the script of ```calibration```.

### 2.4. Storage
The storage interface helps the user to manage its scans, as well as convert it in a 3D STL file.

## 3. Scripts

### 3.1. Main.py

Run the script [main.py](https://github.com/16205/Sid_project/blob/main/code/main.py) to launch the interface

### 3.2. On the Raspberry pi Master

#### 3.2.1. Different Files
In the [/code/raspberry/](https://github.com/16205/Sid_project/tree/main/code/raspberry) folder, you can find the following scripts :
- ```GPIO_setup.py``` : used to set the correct pins in read/write at the start of the application;
- ```copy_slave_pics.py``` : after a scan , the master will copy the pictures taken by the slave in its own folder;
- ```laser.py``` : used to turn on/off and adjust the intensity of the laser;
- ```prise_image_bon.py``` : takes a picture from the master and writes it into a folder with the name of the scan;
- ```scan.py``` : main script that manages the scan (turns the laser, takes pictures, turn the stepper and copy the slave pics);
- ```sshTools.py``` : used to run commands from the master to the slave via the SSH protocol;
- ```stepper.py``` : used to command the stepper and turn a determinated number of steps;
- ```stream.py``` : used to command the slave to stream its video feed through rtsp.

#### 3.2.2. Stereovision Folder
The stereovision folder contains the scripts to calibrate the cameras, but also to transform the pictures in a cloud of 3D points : 
- ```calibration.py```: calibrates the cameras;
- **TO ADD**
- **TO ADD**
- **TO ADD**
- **TO ADD**

#### 3.2.3. Post-processing Folder
This folder contains the scritps to transform a cloud of points into a 3D STL file : 
- ```create_stl.py``` : takes in input a json file in a 3 dimensions matrix and outputs a STL file;
- ```create_points.py``` : creates json files to get examples of working models.

### 3.3. On the Raspberry pi Slave
- **TO ADD**
- **TO ADD**
- **TO ADD**
- **TO ADD**
## 4. PCB design
The [pcb](https://github.com/16205/Sid_project/tree/pcb) branch contains the Gerber files to print through JLCPCB.  
You can find the scematics and the design in the [pdf](https://github.com/16205/Sid_project/tree/pcb/pdf) folder.

The point of this PCB is to have one board, connecting all the needed cables as well as having easy access to the pins. It contains a footprint for :
- A A4988 driver;
- 2 USB-A 2.0 female ports;
- 1 capacitor (12V)
- 1 potentiometer
- pins for the stepper, the alimentation (5 and 12V), the laser and the raspberry pi (master)

## 7. Continue the project

Please Fork the repository if you want to continue our project. If you just want to test it, just clone it.

### 7.1. Dependencies

The project needs you to have a python version of ```3.8.10``` or older, with the following pip modules installed : 
- ```numpy```
- ```numpy-stl```
- ```opencv-python```
- ```mathutils```
- ```kivy```
- ```RpiMotorlib```

### 7.2. Suggested improvements

As said before, this project is still in a state of a prototype. There are still some bugs and unresolved issues due to the limited time we were confronted to. 

Furthermore, due to the chip shortage between 2021 and 2022, we had no choice but use 2 raspberry pi, instead of a single one with an adapter to accept 2 cameras, or a compute module 4. This greatly increased the complexity of the project as the communication between the 2 Raspberry pi's were slow and unconsistant.  

The actual communication between the Rapsberry pi's are through SSH to run scripts, and through RTSP to get video feed (we also tried with TCP and UDP but it's as unconsistant as RTSP).  
To get the pictures from the slave to the master, we used the NFS protocol to mount the slave's ```/home``` folder into the master's ```/mnt``` folder.

All of this would be alleviated if we used a single raspberry pi.

A second suggested improvement, would be to use a single camera instead of 2. Indeed, the stereovision could still be achieved with a single camera and a laser (see this [project](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fabscanoriginal) for example)

Finally, this project lacks in rigor, structure, consistency and easy extensibility. It would be advised to aim for a ["Glass-Box"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility#Glass-Box) extensibility model.
